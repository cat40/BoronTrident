# Boron Umbilical Guide & Exhaust Cover
This mod replaces the back exhaust on the Boron Trident and introduces a guide arm to keep the PTFE bowden tube and umbilical coord from interfering with the X-axis.

Note: The guide head is designed for an umbilical that mounts to the right (A) motor bracket, and is angled to more naturally follow the cable bend. If your umbilical is mounted on the left (B) motor bracket, mirror the arm. If your umbilical is mounted centered, download the CAD file and adjust the angle in Fusion 360.

Quantity | Item | Comment
-|-|-
1x | [[a]_guide_arm.stl](STL/%5Ba%5D_guide_arm.stl) |  Print in obvious orientation.
1x | [[a]_guide_mount.stl](STL/%5Ba%5D_guide_mount.stl) | Print as in picture above, for strength.
1x | [exhaust_cover.stl](STL/exhaust_cover.stl.stl) | Print flat on back, use support for lip. Tree/organic support are easier to remove in this case.

## Bill Of Materials (BOM)
This mod is designed to use the extras you probably have over from your Trident build where possible, check your spares drawer.

The BOM is for installing on a stock Voron Trident, adjustment for your situation.
