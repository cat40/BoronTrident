# Protective Earth (PE), Work in Progress, do not rely on.
What is PE, why do you need it and how do you connect it? Protective Earth, as the name implies, is a safety feature.

Imagine a scenario where the hot mains wire has come lose in your printer and touches the conductive frame[^1]. If you then touch the frame, you will touch mains voltage which will create an electric shock, injuring you, possibly severely, to the point of electrocution if you're unlucky.

That is obviously no bueno. 

We connect the PE wire to all conductive surfaces of the printer, and in your fuse box or similar connect it to neutral with a fuse. Now if the above scenario ocurrs, the hot wire touches the metal frame, which is connected to PE, this causes a short circuit that trips a fuse in your breaker box, protecting you from the device (albeit in a crude way) and letting you know something is wrong.
